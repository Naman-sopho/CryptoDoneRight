<h1>Content Creation Guidelines!</h1>

          Hello, Security Enthusiasts. We appreciate you taking the time and are considering helping us expand this knowledge base. <br /> <br />

          This website aims on a few specific aspects that we will go over through the course of this document. Please follow through the document to get an understanding of our <a href=get-started.html>website</a> and then instructions about how to present document. <br /> <br />

          <font size="3"><strong>Note:</strong></font> <span class="red">This is not a comprehensive list of steps or to do items. It is more of a guide to help structure the content or data to the idealogy that website aims to portray. And the guidelines are generic and try to include as much topics as possible. </span> <br /> <br /> <br />

          Primary Objectives or Major Guidelines:<br /> <br />
          <ul>
          <li>The content must be constructed in a <span class="green">tiered system</span>. The complexity of the topic at hand must increase as the user delves into the pages. A user who wants to know more should be presented with the option to learn more. The Tiered system includes a Landing page (Definition or Introduction) and subsequent inner pages with details. </li>  <br />

          <li>Almost, all pages must have <span class="green">"Actionable takeways!"</span> or banners that possibly summarize the gist of the page and idea that you would like to convey. The motive is that any type of reader (mainly: Manager, IT professional or a Developer) have a thought or idea about security that "sticks". </li>  <br />

          <li>If possible, the content should also be created such that it follows a Concept and Example/Explanation type of model. As seen in this <a href="/dev/articles/cryptographic_protocols/TLS/TLS_1_3/tls_1_3_devQuickstart.html">page</a>.</li>  <br />

          <li>If vulnerabilities or attacks are described, the pages can also be constructed to follow the <span class="green">PIC (Protocol, Implementation or Configuration) model</span>. Please visit this <a href=flaw-categories.html>page</a> to for more information of the PIC model.</li>  <br />

          <li>Each Protocol, Implementation and Configuration is associated to a particular image. Associating your concept with the model and the image helps drive the model further for the readers.</li>  <br />

          <li>Try to accompany every concept with examples that are not specific to a particular vendor. Try to choose the example to be as simple and close to the concept you are trying to explain.</li>  <br />

          <li>Colour Scheme: Green - Good, Red - Bad, Orange - Warning. Pages or concepts that are obsolete or outdated must be have a dull theme to visually dissuade readers. Pages or concepts that are good or "current" must be bright/colorful theme to encourage the readers. </li>  <br />

          <li>For every major concept, please include a FAQs section with the key takeaways.</li>  <br />

          </ul>
          <br /> <br />
          Other Guidelines or Tips:<br /> <br />
          <ul>
          <li>Try to present the data for a individual who is "in the industry but not familiar with security"</li>  <br />

          <li>Minimize security jargon in the higher tier pages and introduce them as you go along. If it is a different concept all together, link the concept.(preferably to another page in this site itself) </li>  <br />
</ul></p>
