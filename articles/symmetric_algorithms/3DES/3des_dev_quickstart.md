## <img src="/static_files/common/implementation.png " style="width:100px;height:100px;" /> 3DES Implementation

### **Concept**
DO NOT roll your own Crypto! Use standard services and libraries.

It is NOT advisable in any circumstances to develop any sort of cryptography on your own. Instead, there are a few options for standard libraries that can be used. These libraries offer better stability as they are usually a product of several years of experience in implementing cryptography by an active development community who are dedicated towards efforts in implementation. It is therefore considered to be reliable and robust.
<br /><br />

#### Examples
OpenSSL is one such library which popular and therefore is used as an example for this concept. OpenSSL is not the only available crypto library. For a list of different libraries and a comparision between them, visit [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_cryptography_libraries).

Find out which openssl version you are using:

Use the version option.

* ```ruby
  $ openssl version
  OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
  ```

You can get much more information with the version -a option.

* ```ruby
  $ openssl version -a
  OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
  built on: Thu Jul 23 19:06:35 UTC 2015
  platform: linux-x86_64

  ```

<span class="red">Please note that OpenSSL 1.0.2k has removed 3DES support. There are still ways you can re-enable 3DES ([Re-enable 3DES](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/08/24/sweet32/)), but considering the security implications, this should be done only if absolutely necessary. </span>

## Usage of Cryptography in Programming Languages
<br />
### **Concept**
It is again advised to not roll out your own cryptography while developing software. There are popular libraries in almost all programming languages that can readily be used to perform cryptographic operations.
<br /><br />

#### Examples
**C/C++**

There are multiple options for libraries that support 3DES in C/C++.
